About this Project

Project Scope:
The project aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer satisfaction within a simulated airline company and its associated factors. The scope encompassed the examination of various satisfaction attributes and their impact on overall passenger experience, with the objective of identifying actionable insights for improvement.

Data Model:
Utilizing a single fact table as the foundation, the data model was constructed to accommodate diverse lookup tables and facilitate analytic processes. Leveraging Power Query, lookup tables were integrated, and additional attributes such as age groups were derived through calculated columns. The adoption of the unpivot technique enabled the transformation of multiple attribute columns into a single attribute column, streamlining analysis. The resulting schema adhered to a Snowflake Schema design, enhancing data organization and accessibility.

Dashboard and Insight:
The dashboard design focused on presenting key survey attributes, assessing factors such as delays and distances, and evaluating satisfaction levels by attribute. Noteworthy insights revealed a predominant satisfaction trend among business travelers, transcending travel class and operational delays. Conversely, dissatisfaction was prominent among economy class passengers and those traveling for personal reasons, highlighting disparities with the business class segment.

Of particular concern was the notably low rating of in-flight Wi-Fi services, particularly among business travelers, signaling an area ripe for improvement. Through these insights, actionable strategies can be devised to enhance customer satisfaction and bridge existing gaps in service quality.
